# BEE2-Addons
### These are some of my custom addons for TSpen10's BEE2 for Portal 2
#### Copy the ZIP file and navigate to your BEE2 folder. Go to Bee2 > Packages and paste the folder there.
#### Be sure to check back here regularly, as this is still a work in progress.

I did this by copying FourthReaper's fizzlers, and modifying the base package. Right now there is one new fizzler.

V1.0 - Base package released. The textures are still a work in progress. As of right now, the fizzler appears pink with a light blue border in the puzzlemaker, light red in game, and pink in BEE2. The fizzler behaves like FourthReaper's Compressed Smoke Field.
